# ADR 1: PROJECT DECISION

**Status:** Accepted 

**Date:** 2025-05-07 

**Deciders:** All members

## Context
We brainstormed different app ideas, but decided to focus on a solution for real-world collectors of physical cards (e.g., baseball, Pok√©mon, etc) Many collectors want to digitally store and display their collections without carrying the physical cards everywhere or trying to show people through camera roll or folders.

We also considered the features that would likely be too complex and time-consuming for our short timeline such as social aspects, card recognition, prices, etc.

## Decision
We will build a web app that allows users to scan, manually organize, and view their physical trading cards in a clean, visually satisfying digital collection.

## Consequences
This app will be a solo user experience.
We will not include social features, trading, or any AI-based recognition. 
A lot of focus will be on the LOOK of the app, the flow and ease.
