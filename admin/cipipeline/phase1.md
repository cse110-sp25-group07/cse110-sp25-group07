# Phase 1 CI Pipeline

![phase1 diagram](./phase1.drawio.png)

## Branch Protection Plan
In our process of development in feature branches, each time code is pushed it runs through a series of tests and status checks:

* ESLint Check
* Prettier Formatting Check
* Jest Tests Check

Then when a pull request is opened, the code must pass all these checks and also gain the approval of one other developer in order to be merged into main.

### ESLint Check
In the process of development developers can use the following command to run the ESLint check which ensures consistent code and prevents bugs:

```bash
npm run lint
```

The pipeline then runs the same line in its own environment automatically whenever code is pushed.

### Prettier Format Check
Prettier is a code formatter that ensures all the code has a consistent style for appearance including spacing and indentation. Developers can format code using the following code:

```bash
npm run format
```

The pipeline then checks to make sure all the files were properly formatted.

### Jest Tests Check
Developers create jest tests to ensure their js functions are working as intended and currently there is a test function that checks for a "valid" card image and as the code for the web application is developed we intend on using functions from our actual code that can ensure our code works as intended. Developers can check their code using the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Future Plans
As we have successfully implemented the approval, ESLint, Prettier, and Jest checks we need to update the Jest tests as we develop the web application and we also plan to include end to end component testing to simulate user test cases of the application and make sure the UI and components function properly in an automatic fashion and add it as another status check that must pass to merge.
