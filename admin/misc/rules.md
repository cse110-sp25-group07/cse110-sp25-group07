# Team 07 - Sevens on the Stack Group Contract

As a team, our goal is to do our best to contribute equally to the project and learn and grow from the experience. We aim to successfully develop the features listed in our Product Requirement Document and do so with quality code following the guidelines we set for ourselves.

## Common Values and Standards

Each team member commits to the following values and standards:

- **Clear and Consistent Communication**
- **Well-documented and quality code**
- **Value each team member’s time and work they put in**
- **Accountability**
- **Staying on task**
- **Dedicating time and staying on top of responsibilities**
- **Not putting each other down**

## Roles, Responsibilities, and Accountability

As a team, we believe in shared responsibility and accountability. We agree to divide work based on strengths, availability, and project needs, while holding ourselves and each other accountable for our work. These responsibilities include:

- Actively participating in group discussions and meetings
- Completing assigned tasks by designated deadlines
- Testing and reviewing each other’s work while providing feedback
- Engaging in communication to keep the team informed of progress, blockers, and availability
- Performing regular check-ins during meetings or via Slack to keep track of everyone's work

## Potential Issues and Conflict Resolution Strategies

As a team, we recognize that potential issues and conflicts are likely to arise and we aim to address them promptly and constructively:

1. Address issue/conflict privately between the involved/concerned parties
2. Bring the issue forward to the whole group in a neutral and respectful manner
3. If still unresolved, escalate the issue to the TA/instructor

## Addressing Situations where Group Rules are Broken

It is our responsibility as individuals to follow group guidelines and rules. If a member repeatedly breaks these guidelines, the rest of the group must take action:

1. The concerned individual will receive an acknowledgment of their behavior and a chance to correct it.
2. If behavior is not corrected and incidents continue to occur, a reallocation of responsibilities will be considered.
3. Persistent behavior beyond normal will result in the escalation of the problem to the TA/instructor.

## Communication Protocols

- **Primary Communication Tool**: Slack, for daily communication and updates.
- **Weekly Meetings**: Typically scheduled on Wednesdays during lab time (12:00 to 2:50) through Zoom or in person.
- **Task Tracking**: GitHub Issues, updates on Slack, or Miro Board. 
  All important decisions should be documented one way or another.
